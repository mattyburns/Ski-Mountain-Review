Top Mountains - A Ski-Mountain Review Site

Top Mountains is a React/Rails app built to allow winter sports fans to contribute to a growing base of ski mountain reviews. Ski fans can add their favorite mountains and write reviews on their ski, lodging, and food experiences. Top rated mountains rise to the top of the site, and users can weigh-in on reviews by upvoting ratings they agree with. Admin privileges allow you to maintain a clean and friendly site for all to use.
